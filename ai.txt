AI:
•Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
	⁃yes.
	⁃whenever the computer’s turn, check all 7 possible steps, and after each step take, check all the following steps by using Monte Carlo algorithm with test runs around hundreds.
	⁃make the player and computer to randomly choose the next step till the game is over, win or tie or lose
	⁃record this hundreds of test run’s win scores. win count 1 lose count 0, and tie count 0.2
	⁃pick the highest score step from the test run.
•If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
	⁃a little, while testing, there is an amount of time that the computer can win.
	•How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
	⁃pick the next move according to the process I described above. The highest score’s move from those hundreds of test runs.
•How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
	⁃around 60% the computer will win.
	•How would you improve it in the future?
	⁃not sure. Might be give the Monte Carlo test run for two steps test runs. make the computer thinking two steps a head.
